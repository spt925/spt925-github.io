		  <p class="about">How often do you watch a movie with seeing the review first? When you saw the movie were you satisfied? If not we review the lastest movies to save you the hassel or give you something to look forward to. Why wait and take the risk of going to the theater over a movie you may not enjoy. Our focus is to inform many visitors as possible of all our movies listed including our own personal ratings. Bringing an impact on the community providing honest views on movies to their best interest. Media and technology are at the very center of all our lives today especially our childrenâ€™s. Kids today spend over 50 hours of screen time every week. The media content they consume and create has a profound impact on their social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development.  Learning how to use media and technology wisely is an essential skill for life and learning in the 21st century. But parents, teachers, and policymakers struggle to keep up with the rapidly changing digital world in which our children live and learn. Now more than ever, they need a trusted guide to help them navigate a world where change is the only constant. Children are the future on a yearly average theres millions of movies being viewed by children. We made sure to even offer many reviews on kid movies too. The Children movie that sold the most tickets this year was Beauty and the Beast. This great movie sold over 56 million tickets. Youth shows are just important if not profitable. Going into other movies the most popular one this year was Wonder Woman which sold at $412 Million. We want to impact people to be the part of the reason movies are being sold at high viewa. With our engineers we will provide the lastest movies providing detailed information about every show listed.   </p>
